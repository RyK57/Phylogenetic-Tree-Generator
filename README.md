# Phylogenetic-Tree-Generator
Generates Phylogenetic Trees based on FASTA Sequences

A streamlit app built with python and biopython modules, with matplotlib for presenting a phylogenetic tree. It performs actions of reading a fasta sequence text file, align them using ClustalW method and return the tree using maximum likelihood algorithm and distance matrix calculation. 

Learnt Computational Biology Fundamentals of working with nucleotide sequences and data science approaches towards those.

Developed skills of file formatting and handling with python, defining computational functions to work with biological data and return results using computational biological algorithms
